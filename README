MINILIGHT-CL is my attempt to make a "common-lispy" port of the
MiniLight Global Illumination Renderer: http://www.hxa.name/minilight/

It is a mostly faithful port with regard to the original code
base. However there are a couple of major changes:
 
 * I'm experimenting with slope-rays as defined by 
   M. Eisemann, T. Grosch, S. MÃ¼ller, M. Magnor,
   Journal of Graphic Tools, vol. 12, no. 4
   (full link in rays.lisp). 
   I hope a 'smarter' ray will allow for simpler index walking.

 * I'm using CLOS objects to define AABBs and rays rather than
   straight vectors like the original source.
